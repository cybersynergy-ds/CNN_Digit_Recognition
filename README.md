Handwritten Digit Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using MNIST Dataset

Description: Developed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Achieved high accuracy in recognizing digits from 0 to 9.
Key Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
Approach:

Loaded and preprocessed the MNIST dataset, normalizing and reshaping the input images to fit the model.
Designed and built a CNN model with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
Optimized the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, achieving a test accuracy of 98%+.
Visualized training and testing results using Matplotlib.
Outcome: The model was able to classify handwritten digits with high accuracy, showcasing the power of CNNs for image classification tasks.
